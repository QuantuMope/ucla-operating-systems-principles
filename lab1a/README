lab1a: Program that enables character-at-a-time, full
       duplex terminal I/O. Run by itself, the program
       will simply echo back input. Provided the --shell
       argument, the program will initiate polled I/O
       between a child shell process running \bin\bash
       and the terminal process. Upon program completion
       via ^C (SIGINT) or ^D (EOF), original terminal
       settings are reinstated. Terminal settings will
       not be reinstated if a system call error occurs.

Included files:
lab1a.c  - C source module
README   - description of included files
Makefile - makefile to build program and tarball, supports
           the following commands:
           make       - build the lab1a executable
           make clean - remove any files created by the Makefile
           make dist  - build a tarball lab1a-205348339.tar.gz
                        containing all included files

For grabbing the correct exit signal and status, I used the included macros
shown in waitpid(2) rather than doing the bit operations myself.
