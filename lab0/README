lab0.c         - C source module

Smoke-test cases:
I used twelve cases to test the lab0 executable which makes sure
that the expected return code was received for a set of arguments.
The cases with a brief description for each are listed below.

Case 1: Pass an input file argument that does not exist.
Expected return code 2.
Case 2: Use the segfault argument and the catch argument in that order.
Expected return code of 4.
Case 3: Same as case 2 but use the catch argument first.
Expected return code of 4.
Case 4: Enter an invalid argument.
Expected return code of 1.
Case 5: Enter valid arguments with an invalid argument at the end.
Expected return code of 1.
Case 6: Enter valid arguments with an invalid argument in the middle.
Expected return code of 1.
