README          - description of all included files as well as answers
                  to the project questions
Makefile        - makefile to build program and tarball, supports
                  the following commands:
          make        - build the lab1a executable
          make clean  - remove any files created by the Makefile
          make dist   - build a tarball lab2a-205348339.tar.gz
                      - containing all included files
          make tests  - Conduct over 200 test cases and save the
                      - results in csv files
          make graphs - Create gnu plots using data obtained from
                        the csv files

Questions:

2.3.1: Most of the cycles spent in the 1 and 2-thread list tests are
       are being spent on execution of the code.

       Most of the time/cycles for high-thread spin-lock tests are
       being spent on waiting spinning threads.
       Most of the time/cycles for high-thread mutex tests are being
       spent on expensive context switches and checking whether or
       not a lock is free.

2.3.2:
