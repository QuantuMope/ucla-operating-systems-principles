lab4c_tcp - Program connects to an embedded system (Beaglebone) and
            reads and reports temperature from sensor. Sends sensor
            readings to a server via TCP. Accepts commands from the
            server. Logs all given commands.
lab4c_tls - Same as lab4c_tcp except socket communication uses SSL
            encryption.


            Both programs accept the following command line arguments:
            --scale=[C|F]   change temperature scale to Celsius or Fahrenheit
            --period=#      change the reporting period (seconds)
            The following are MANDATORY.
            --log=FILENAME  log reports to provided file
            --host=NAME     name of the host to connect to
            --id=9-DIGIT-#  id for server identification purposes
            A port number must also be provided.
